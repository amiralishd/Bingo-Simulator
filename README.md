# Bingo-Simulator

In this script, I simulated a number of random plays of Bingo to examine the winning chances of different cards and verify that there is no preference between any of them. I also checked my simulated results with the theoritical results. Feel free to probe the Jupyter Notebook file.

I hope my friends see now that I'm not a cheater and simply happened to win twice in row :D
