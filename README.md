# Bingo-Simulator

In this script, I tried to simulate a number of random plays of Bingo to see what the chances are for each card to win and verify that there is no preference between them. I also checked my simulated results with the ones from theoritical approach. Please feel free to probe the Jupyter Notebook file.

I hope my friends Maryam, Maral, Setare, Nasser and Soheil believe now that it was only by chance that I won the game twice in row that night :D
